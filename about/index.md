I'm a final-year Informatics Engineering student with a deep interest in artificial intelligence and data science. Throughout my academic journey, I've built AI-powered solutions, from an award-winning maternal health chatbot to a phishing detection system using LLMs. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, and I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments. With a strong foundation in machine learning, NLP, and software engineering, I'm eager to bring impactful innovation to the tech industry.
